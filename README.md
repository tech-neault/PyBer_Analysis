# PyBer Ridesharing Analysis
## A Look into PyBer's Ridership and Demographics

## Overview
This analysis has been requested by PyBer in order to examine the shares of each market type (City, Suburban, and Rural). By merging two datasets, we combined rider and city data to create a new Data Frame that includes a summary of total rides, total drivers, total fares ($), average fare per ride, and average fare a driver makes per ride. Then, the data was resampled with a focus on January to April 2019. We found the average fare per week during this time for each market type. The data from these analyses have been summarized below to provide understanding and recommendations for the future to PyBer's CEO.


## Results

From this multiple line chart, we can visualize how the total fares for each market type (Urban, Suburban, and Rural) vary from each other but appear stable over time.
